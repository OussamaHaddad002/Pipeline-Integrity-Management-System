# Pipeline Risk Assessment Dashboard - Development Instructions

## Project Overview
This is a comprehensive pipeline integrity management system for IRM Systems targeting the oil & gas industry. The system visualizes pipeline networks, calculates risk assessments, and uses AI for failure prediction.

## Technology Stack
- Frontend: React 18+ with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Leaflet maps
- Backend: Node.js with Express.js and TypeScript  
- Database: PostgreSQL 15.13-3 with PostGIS 3.4.2 extension
- AI/ML: Python integration for risk prediction models
- Deployment: Docker containerization, AWS deployment ready

## Progress Checklist
- [x] Project structure created
- [x] Frontend scaffold setup (React + TypeScript + Vite)
- [x] Backend scaffold setup (Node.js + Express + TypeScript)
- [x] Database configuration (PostgreSQL + PostGIS schema)
- [x] AI model implementation (Python scikit-learn)
- [x] Docker configuration (Multi-stage builds)
- [x] Documentation completion (Comprehensive README)
- [x] Sample data generation (Realistic pipeline data)
- [x] Production configuration (Docker Compose prod)

## Key Features Implemented
